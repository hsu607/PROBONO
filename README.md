Welcome to Probono GitHub repository! I participated in the Probono ICT Mentoring Project 2022. Our team consisted of four mentees and our mentor, and we worked together to develop a new risk index based on the GAM model and an activity recommendation system for the vulnerable class of fine dust. Here, you can find information about our projects and access the code we have developed.

## 📅 Project Timeline
Our project was conducted between April 2022 and November 2022 as part of the Probono ICT Mentoring Project. During this time, we conducted research, analyzed data, developed models, and created a presentation for the 2022 ACK 2022 ICT Mentoring conference.

## 💡 Research
Our research focused on analyzing fine dust levels in a smart city and identifying vulnerable populations that may be more affected by the adverse health effects of fine dust. We developed a new risk index based on the GAM model and used it to recommend activities that could reduce exposure to fine dust for the vulnerable class.

## 📝 Paper
Our research findings were presented in a paper titled "A Smart city study trough development of new risk index based on GAM model and activity recommendation system for the vulnerable class of fine dust." The paper was published in the Proceedings of the Korea Information Processing Society Conference (2022), and you can find the paper in this repository. Also, the paper can be accessed through the following link: https://doi.org/10.3745/PKIPS.Y2022M11A.1009
